title: Strictly NetBeans
summary: Apache NetBeansÂ® in a strictly-confined snap
description: |
  Apache NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE)
  for Java, with extensions for PHP, C, C++, HTML5, JavaScript,
  and other languages. Applications based on NetBeans, including the
  NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third-party developers.

  This package provides the latest release of NetBeans built directly
  from its source code on GitHub. If the OpenJDK Snap package is
  also installed, this package connects to it automatically for the
  location of its Java Development Kit runtime and tools.

  This Snap package is strictly confined, running in complete
  isolation with only limited access to your system resources. For
  more information, see the repository for this package on GitHub:

  https://github.com/jgneff/strictly-netbeans

  This is a convenience binary of the Apache NetBeans IDE and not a
  release by the Apache Software Foundation. Official releases are at:

  https://netbeans.apache.org

  Apache NetBeans and the NetBeans logo are either registered
  trademarks or trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation in the
  United States and/or other countries.
