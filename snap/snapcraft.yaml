summary: Apache NetBeans IDE for the OpenJDK Snap
description: |
  Apache NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE)
  for Java, with extensions for other languages like PHP, JavaScript,
  HTML5, Groovy, C, and C++. Applications based on NetBeans, including
  the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third party developers.

  This package provides the NetBeans IDE for Linux and uses the OpenJDK
  Snap package, if installed, when the JAVA_HOME environment variable
  is not set. Building this package downloads the NetBeans source code
  directly from the Apache Web site, verifies its SHA-512 hash value,
  and builds NetBeans from source.

  For more information, see the repository for this package on GitHub:

  https://github.com/jgneff/mynetbeans
