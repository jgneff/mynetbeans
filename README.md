This project builds a Snap package of the [Apache NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/) which uses the [OpenJDK Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/openjdk), if installed, when the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is not set. Building this package downloads the NetBeans Binaries ZIP file directly from the [Apache Web site](https://downloads.apache.org/) and verifies its SHA512 hash value before extracting the contents.
