[Apache NetBeans][netbeans] is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java, with extensions for other languages like PHP, C, C++, HTML5, and JavaScript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third-party developers.

This package provides the latest release of NetBeans built directly from its [source code][source] on GitHub. If the [OpenJDK Snap package][openjdk] is also installed, this package connects to it during installation for the location of its Java Development Kit runtime and tools.
